# Getting Started with Create React App

1.Install create-react-app globally : npm install -g create-react-app

2.Create a new React project with TypeScript: npx create-react-app wine-data-echart --template typescript

3.Navigate into the project directory: cd wine-data-echart

4.Remove the existing code and files: Delete the contents of src folder except for index.tsx and react-app-env.d.ts files.

## Next, let's install the required dependencies:

## Install ECharts for React: yarn add echarts-for-react

## Now, let's implement the line chart and bar chart

Line Chart to be drawn between “Flavanoids” on the horizontal axis and “Ash” on the vertical axis. 

Bar chart to be drawn showing the “Alcohol” categories on the horizontal axis and the minimum “Magnesium” value for each alcohol category on the vertical axis.

## In the project directory, you can run: yarn start

Finally, run yarn start to start the development server. The browser should open with the line chart and bar chart rendered.
